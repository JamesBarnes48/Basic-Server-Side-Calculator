# Basic-Server-Side-Calculator
Very simple web app that consists of two calculators on two different pages which performs calculations server-side and sends them back to the user. Very simple app made to get to grips with Node.js and Express.

Requires the following packages to be installed through the command line:
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1"
(could not include node-modules with this due to file size)
